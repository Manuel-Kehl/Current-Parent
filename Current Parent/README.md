Current-Parent
==============

A plugin for the GetSimple CMS, which adds the "current" class to the parent of the active navigation list item.

I created this, because I am using the [Child Menu](http://get-simple.info/extend/plugin/child-menu/40/) Plugin
for displaying a set of pages, categorized by their parent pages and wanted both the actual active child page
and it's parent to be highlighted as "current".

Right now there is nothing being added to the administration backend. I felt like this would bloat the 
administration menu for no reason, as the only interesting setting so far may be toggling the plugin's functionality
itself, which can be done by en/disabling the plugin.

If you feel different about that matter or want to contribute something else, feel free to do so ;-)
